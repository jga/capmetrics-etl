About ``capmetrics-etl``
------------------------

In February of 2016, the Capital Metro Transportation Authority - which serves
the central Texas region - began releasing a semi-annually-updated
spreadsheet of ridership statistics. The spreadsheet is an Excel file with the ``xls`` format.

The **capmetrics-etl** application provides command line utilities for parsing
the released data and persisting it into a database.
